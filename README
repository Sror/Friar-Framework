# Friar Framework #
The Friar Framework is a tool for generating Android ebook apps. It is based on and inspired by the Baker Framework for iOS (www.bakerframework.com) and the name is sort of a play on words.

## Installation ##
Download the framework via GitHub.

## Setup ##
You most likely want to change the following items in the project:
* One
* Two
* Three

## eBook Content ##
Much like the Baker Framework, Friar expects your ebook in the HPub format. Basically this consists of all your book pages in HTML format in a directory called book/ inside the asset/ directory. Each page's filename must be in alphabetical or numerical order. An example book is included in the Friar Framework. 

### Raw Text to HTML ###
If you are interested in a way to generate HTML from text, I recommend checking out Jekyll (www.jekyllrb.com). I use it for quick and easy templating of static text, which makes taking raw text content and transforming it into HTML fairly easy. As a side note, Jekyll is also the engine used for GitHub Pages.

### PDF to HTML ###
If you have a PDF version of your ebook already, you can use pdftohtml (http://pdftohtml.sourceforge.net) to transform your PDF into an HTML file.

There are other free services online (just Google for "pdf to html") but I can't vouch for any of them. If you have a good or bad experience I'd love to hear about it though.

## Service ##
